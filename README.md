# Advent Of Code 2024

This year in python! Code will be horrible, undocumented and barely working, so like prod code but with a good excuse this time...

## How to use

If you want to run those solutions, use `python 3.12`, create .venv with `python -m venv .venv` and get the requirements. You need to set your token, follow the doc of AOCD module to do so.
